cvsutils
========

cvsutils is a set of utility programs that address limitations and
missing features in the official CVS command-line interface. The
utilities are written in Perl and call CVS via the Cvs module. 

== PROGRAMS ==

* cvsstat

Generates a report of the current state of a working copy in a format
similar to that used by Subversion's 'svn status' command. It's more
useful for checking the state of your checkout than 'cvs status',
which produces a mostly irrelevant wall o' text. It produces most of
the same information as 'cvs -n update -d' but with more detail and in
a much more readable format.

In the future I plan to have it parse the sticky tags. Once it does it
will tell you what branch you're on and warn of any inconsistencies.
